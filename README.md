Ecliptic's Yeoman generators for scaffolding new applications

## Installation

```sh
$ yarn global add @ecliptic/shipyard
```

You can also use npm:

```sh
$ npm install -g @ecliptic/shipyard
```

## Usage

Currently, our only generator builds a simple React web project. This will likely be expanded in the future to cover other types of projects as well - including templates for React Native, "serverless" endpoints, and universal applications.

### React

To bootstrap a React web project, use the `react` generator:

```sh
$ mkdir my-new-project
$ cd my-new-project
$ yo @eclpitic/shipyard:react
```

Answer the questions, and you'll have a brand new web application set up in your current directory. Tada! ðŸŽ‰
